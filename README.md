# machine-condition-monitoring-system
This project is a real-time machine condition monitoring system that collects data from sensors mounted on machines on a production line, sends the data to a central database, and analyzes it to detect anomalies. I will simulate data collection for a single machine (machine1) and perform preliminary data analysis to identify potential problems.
